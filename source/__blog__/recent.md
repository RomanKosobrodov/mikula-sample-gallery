# Recent

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even link to [Mikula](https://github.com/RomanKosobrodov/mikula)!

## Section 1.1

This is subsection of the recent post

### Section 1.1.1

This is subsection of Section 1.1.

## Emphasis

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

## Lists

They can be unordered

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

And ordered

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b

## Backquotes

> But man is not made for defeat. 
> A man can be destroyed but not defeated.

Ernest Hemingway
